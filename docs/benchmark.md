# Benchmark Results

This document summarizes the performance benchmarking results between the **Go** and other implementations of the json-rpc-relay. Tests were performed using [k6](https://k6.io/) for load testing and custom end-to-end (E2E) integration tests. The goal is to provide an objective comparison and highlight areas for optimization in each implementation.

## Overview
We compared two implementations of the same product:
- **Other Implementation**  
- **Go Implementation**

This document aims to:
- Compare response times, throughput, and resource usage under various loads.
- Provide insights that can guide optimization and further development efforts.

**Infrastructure:**
- **Operating System:** MacOs 15.1
- **CPU:** Apple M4 Pro
- **Memory:** 24 GB
- **Network:** Docker container-based setup
- **Docker Resources:**
  - **CPU:** 2 cores
  - **Memory:** 1 GB RAM


**Software Versions:**
- **Node.js:** v20.x
- **Go:** 1.22

## Methodology

### k6 Load Test
1. **Scenario**: Testing operations on the core API endpoints.  
2. **k6 Script**:
   - Virtual users: 50, 100, 200, and 500.  
   - Duration: 5 minutes per load step, 1 minute ramp-up between steps.  
   - Endpoints tested are the same as the ones in the [RPC API](docs/rpc-api.md)
   - Metrics collected:
     - **Response time (p95, p99)**  
     - **Throughput (requests per second)**  
     - **CPU & Memory usage** (collected via system monitoring or container metrics)

### E2E Tests
1. **Scenario**: Using the same test suite to validate the end-to-end flow, from client to database.  
2. **Tooling**: Custom test scripts using **Jest** (Node.js) and **Go testing**.  
3. **Metrics**:
   - **Execution time** for the entire test suite.  
   - **Pass/Fail** count of test cases.  
   - **Resource usage** (if applicable).

   - The Go implementation consistently outperforms the Other implementation across all tested endpoints
   - Most significant performance difference is in eth_getTransactionByHash, where Go is ~50x faster
   - Lowest performance gain is in eth_call, where Go is still ~29% faster
   - Request throughput is substantially higher in Go, ranging from 40% to 60x improvement
   - Average response times are consistently lower in Go implementation

2. **Resource Utilization**:
   - Go implementation shows dramatically better resource efficiency:
     - CPU usage is 20x lower on average (0.05% vs 1%)
     - Memory consumption is 11x lower on average (30MB vs 340MB)
     - Peak memory usage shows even greater efficiency (40MB vs 1360MB)
     - Disk I/O is significantly reduced, with 550x less disk reads and no disk writes
   - Lower resource utilization suggests better scalability and cost-effectiveness in production

3. **Stability**:
   - Go implementation shows more consistent performance with lower CPU peaks (95% vs 135.55%)
